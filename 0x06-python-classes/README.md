# 0x06-python-classes

This directory contains Python scripts that illustrate the concept of classes and object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python. Each script focuses on different aspects of defining and using classes to create objects with attributes and methods.

## Files:

1. **0-main.py**
   - Main script to test the basic class structure.

2. **0-square.py**
   - Python script that defines an empty class `Square`.

3. **1-main.py**
   - Main script to test the instantiation of a class with attributes.

4. **1-square.py**
   - Python script that defines a class `Square` with a private attribute `size`.

5. **100-main.py**
   - Main script to test the implementation of a singly linked list.

6. **100-singly_linked_list.py**
   - Python script that defines a class `Node` to create a singly linked list.

7. **101-square.py**
   - Python script that enhances the `Square` class with getter and setter methods for the `size` attribute.

8. **102-square.py**
   - Python script that adds comparison methods to the `Square` class.

9. **103-magic_class.py**
   - Python script that defines a class `MagicClass` with attributes and methods to mimic a specified bytecode.

10. **2-main.py**
    - Main script to test the instantiation of a class with attributes and methods.

11. **2-square.py**
    - Python script that enhances the `Square` class with an area calculation method.

12. **3-main.py**
    - Main script to test the addition of more methods to the `Square` class.

13. **3-square.py**
    - Python script that further enhances the `Square` class with methods for printing the square.

14. **4-main.py**
    - Main script to test the use of special methods in the `Square` class.

15. **4-square.py**
    - Python script that adds special methods to the `Square` class for string representation and comparison.

16. **5-main.py**
    - Main script to test the use of class inheritance.

17. **5-square.py**
    - Python script that defines a subclass `Square` inheriting from a superclass.

18. **6-main.py**
    - Main script to test the use of class inheritance and method overriding.

19. **6-square.py**
    - Python script that defines a subclass `Square` inheriting from a superclass and overrides a method.

Feel free to explore these scripts to gain a better understanding of how to define and use classes in Python, implement inheritance, and work with special methods for customizing class behavior. Each script is self-contained and can be executed individually to observe the behavior of the implemented classes.
