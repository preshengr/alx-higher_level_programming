## 0x0F. Python - Object-relational mapping

### Description
The goal of this project is to learn how to use an Object-relational mapper (ORM). We'll use the `MySQLdb` module in Python to connect to a MySQL database, and then the `SQLAlchemy` module for the ORM.

### Background Context
In this project, we'll bridge two amazing worlds: Databases and Python! Here's what we'll cover:

1. **MySQLdb Connection and SQL Queries**
   - We'll use the `MySQLdb` module to connect to a MySQL database and execute SQL queries directly.
   - Example (without ORM):
     ```python
     conn = MySQLdb.connect(host="localhost", port=3306, user="root", passwd="root", db="my_db", charset="utf8")
     cur = conn.cursor()
     cur.execute("SELECT * FROM states ORDER BY id ASC")
     query_rows = cur.fetchall()
     for row in query_rows:
         print(row)
     cur.close()
     conn.close()
     ```

2. **SQLAlchemy ORM**
   - We'll switch to using the `SQLAlchemy` ORM, which abstracts storage details.
   - No more direct SQL queries! We'll work with Python objects.
   - Example (with ORM):
     ```python
     engine = create_engine('mysql+mysqldb://{}:{}@localhost/{}'.format("root", "root", "my_db"), pool_pre_ping=True)
     Base.metadata.create_all(engine)
     session = Session(engine)
     for state in session.query(State).order_by(State.id).all():
         print("{}: {}".format(state.id, state.name))
     session.close()
     ```
