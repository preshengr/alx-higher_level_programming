# 0x0B Python - Input/Output

This repository contains Python scripts that demonstrate various input/output operations in Python, including file handling, JSON serialization/deserialization, and more.

## Files

1. **0-read_file.py**: Python script that reads a text file (`UTF8`) and prints its content to stdout.

2. **1-write_file.py**: Python script that writes a string to a text file (`UTF8`) and returns the number of characters written.

3. **2-append_write.py**: Python script that appends a string at the end of a text file (`UTF8`) and returns the number of characters added.

4. **3-to_json_string.py**: Python function that returns the JSON representation of an object (string).

5. **4-from_json_string.py**: Python function that returns an object (Python data structure) represented by a JSON string.

6. **5-save_to_json_file.py**: Python function that writes an object to a text file using JSON representation.

7. **6-load_from_json_file.py**: Python function that creates an object from a JSON file.

8. **7-add_item.py**: Python script that adds all arguments to a Python list and saves them to a file.

9. **8-class_to_json.py**: Python function that returns the dictionary description with simple data structure for JSON serialization of an object.

10. **9-student.py**: Python class `Student` that defines a student with public instance attributes.

11. **10-student.py**: Updated version of the `Student` class with a new method `to_json()` that retrieves a dictionary representation of a `Student` instance.

12. **11-student.py**: Updated version of the `Student` class with a new method `reload_from_json()` that replaces all attributes of the `Student` instance.

13. **12-pascal_triangle.py**: Python function that returns a list of lists representing the Pascal's triangle of `n`.

14. **100-append_after.py**: Python function that inserts a line of text to a file after each line containing a specific string.

15. **101-stats.py**: Python script that reads `stdin` line by line and computes metrics such as total size, status code counts, and more.

Feel free to explore these scripts for learning purposes or practical use cases in Python programming.
