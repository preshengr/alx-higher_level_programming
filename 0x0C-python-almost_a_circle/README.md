# 0x0B Python - Input/Output

Welcome to the `0x0B-python-input_output` repository! This repository contains Python scripts that demonstrate various input/output operations in Python, including file handling, JSON serialization/deserialization, and more.

## Files and Descriptions

1. **0-read_file.py**: This script reads a text file (`UTF8`) and prints its content to stdout.

2. **1-write_file.py**: This script writes a string to a text file (`UTF8`) and returns the number of characters written.

3. **2-append_write.py**: This script appends a string at the end of a text file (`UTF8`) and returns the number of characters added.

4. **3-to_json_string.py**: This script defines a function that returns the JSON representation of an object (string).

5. **4-from_json_string.py**: This script defines a function that returns an object (Python data structure) represented by a JSON string.

6. **5-save_to_json_file.py**: This script defines a function that writes an object to a text file using JSON representation.

7. **6-load_from_json_file.py**: This script defines a function that creates an object from a JSON file.

8. **7-add_item.py**: This script adds all arguments to a Python list and saves them to a file.

9. **8-class_to_json.py**: This script defines a function that returns the dictionary description with simple data structure for JSON serialization of an object.

10. **9-student.py**: This script defines a Python class `Student` that represents a student with public instance attributes.

11. **10-student.py**: This script provides an updated version of the `Student` class with a new method `to_json()` that retrieves a dictionary representation of a `Student` instance.

12. **11-student.py**: This script provides an updated version of the `Student` class with a new method `reload_from_json()` that replaces all attributes of the `Student` instance.

13. **12-pascal_triangle.py**: This script defines a Python function that returns a list of lists representing the Pascal's triangle of `n`.

14. **100-append_after.py**: This script defines a Python function that inserts a line of text to a file after each line containing a specific string.

15. **101-stats.py**: This script defines a Python script that reads `stdin` line by line and computes metrics such as total size, status code counts, and more.
